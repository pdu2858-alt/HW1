# Project Development Steps

This document outlines the step-by-step process followed to create, deploy, and document the Simple Linear Regression Visualizer application.

### Step 1: Initial Setup & Project Scaffolding (Flask Version)

1.  **Directory Setup**: Created the project directory `hw1`.
2.  **File Creation**: Created the initial set of files: `app.py`, `templates/index.html`, `requirements.txt`, `idea.md`, `log.md`, and `README.md`.
3.  **Core Logic**: Wrote the Python code in `app.py` for:
    - Generating synthetic data based on a linear equation.
    - Training a `LinearRegression` model from `scikit-learn`.
    - Generating a `matplotlib` plot to visualize the results.
4.  **Web Interface**: Developed a simple HTML interface in `index.html` with a form to take user input for the model parameters.
5.  **Flask Integration**: Wrote the Flask boilerplate to connect the backend logic to the HTML frontend, handle form submissions, and display the plot.
6.  **Dependency Listing**: Populated `requirements.txt` with the necessary libraries (`Flask`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).

### Step 2: Version Control with Git

1.  **Initialize Repository**: Ran `git init` in the project directory.
2.  **Add Remote**: Added the GitHub repository as the remote origin (`git remote add origin ...`).
3.  **First Commit**: Staged all files (`git add .`) and made the initial commit (`git commit -m "Initial commit"`).
4.  **Push to GitHub**: Pushed the initial version to the `master` branch on GitHub (`git push -u origin master`).

### Step 3: Conversion to Streamlit

1.  **Analysis**: Reviewed the existing Flask application to understand its core functionality.
2.  **Create Streamlit Script**: Wrote a new script, `streamlit_app.py`, to replicate the functionality using Streamlit's components.
3.  **UI Migration**: Replaced the HTML form with `st.sidebar.slider` for interactive controls.
4.  **Plotting**: Modified the plotting function to return a Matplotlib figure object, which was then rendered using `st.pyplot()`.
5.  **Layout Design**: Used `st.columns` to create a more organized and professional-looking layout.
6.  **Update Dependencies**: Modified `requirements.txt` to remove `Flask` and add `Streamlit`.
7.  **File Management**: Renamed `streamlit_app.py` to `app.py` for deployment convenience and deleted the now-obsolete Flask files (`app.py` and the `templates/` directory).

### Step 4: Final Documentation and Cleanup

1.  **Update README**: Rewrote the `README.md` to reflect the new Streamlit application, including updated setup instructions and a better project description.
2.  **Complete `idea.md`**: Expanded the initial notes into a full project idea document.
3.  **Update `log.md`**: Added a changelog entry for the migration to Streamlit.
4.  **Create `steps.md`**: Wrote this document to provide a clear, step-by-step history of the development process.
5.  **Final Commit**: Staged all the documentation changes and new application code.
6.  **Push to GitHub**: Pushed the final, documented version to the GitHub repository.
